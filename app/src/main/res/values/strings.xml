    Smart नारी is a supportive community helping anyone and everyone to free
    themselves of gender based violence (GBV) in order to enjoy healthy and
    safe sexuality and relationships.
    </div>
</p>
<p align="justify>
    <div>
The app allows you to instantly report    <b>Report Abuse and Violence</b> whenever and wherever you
    experience it. It offers access to services and the information you need to
    stand your ground and protect your safety and well-being.

</p>
<p>
    <div>
    The community <b>nurtures a positive sense of self</b>,

<p>
    <div>
    Smart नारी was created by a group of women and men determined to end the
    silent suffering of thousands of Nepalese experiencing abuse in what should
    be the safe haven of their own homes and intimate relationships. (See Meet
    the Team).

    Absolute Zero Tolerance of violence.

    How? By promoting empowerment, sexual health, sexuality education, good
    sex, and even stress and anger management as part and parcel of preventing
    GBV.

    <div>
    Smart नारी brings you the information, access to services and community

        within the home and marriage rather than from strangers”.
    </i>
    How often do we say "Stop!” to someone abusing us, or intervene in
    another’s violent domestic dispute? Do we brush off what happens within our
    own families whilst supporting anti-GBV campaign posts on Facebook? How
often have we thought, “    <i>That would never happen to a woman like me...”</i>

Talking about the "S" word isn’t easy, but we can help you normalise that<b>dialogue</b> until it becomes easier for you and your partner.    <strong>Sex</strong> is wonderful but <strong>it can sting</strong>! Learn
about <b>safer sex </b>and still have lots of<b>fun</b>. We will help you discriminate between life enhancing    <b>GOOD SEX</b> behaviours as opposed to pornography, and to
