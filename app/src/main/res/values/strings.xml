    How often do we say "Stop!” to someone abusing us, or intervene in
    another’s violent domestic dispute? Do we brush off what happens within our
    own families whilst supporting anti-GBV campaign posts on Facebook? How
often have we thought, “    <i>That would never happen to a woman like me...”</i>

    <p>The Smart नारी “App,” allows you with one big shake of the mobile to <strong> instantly contact your “My Circle” in case of trouble and to report </strong> <strong> abuse, violence </strong> <strong> and harm </strong> , whenever and wherever you experience it. It also <strong> offers information on relevant public and NGO support services </strong> that you can access to stand your ground; protect yourself and those around you.</p>
    <p>The Smart नारी community nurtures a positive sense of self and self-image and sets high standards for the quality of our personal relationships. We empower each other to question abusive relationships and refuse to live in fear for there is so much more to live for.</p>
    <p>Smart नारी was created by a group of women and men determined to end the silent suffering of thousands of Nepalese, overwhelmingly these are women but not always, in what should be the safe haven of our own homes, offices and intimate relationships.</p>
    <p><strong> Our Philosophy </strong></p>
    <p><strong> ZERO TOLERANCE OF ABUSE, VIOLENCE AND HARM </strong></p>
    <p>How? By preventing gender based violence (GBV) and promoting empowerment, sexual health, timely recognition of extreme anxiety, providing stress relief and anger management as part and parcel of preventing abuse and stopping the violence that causes so much harm.</p>
    <p><strong> No woman is an island </strong> and for that matter no man or whichever gender identity or sexual orientation you may go by. But, how often do we brush off what happens within our own families whilst supporting anti-GBV campaigns or just clicking “Like” on relevant Facebook posts? How often have we thought ‘ <em> that would never happen to a woman like me... </em> ? Or worse “ <em> She asked for it. </em> ” In our book no one deserves abuse and violence, whatever the reason.</p>
    <p><strong> Sex matters </strong> to your overall health <strong> . </strong> We promote sexual relationships that are consensual and non-exploitative.</p>
    <p>We want to help make your voice count. No judgments! Promise. Talk to us about values, emotions, passions, desires and pleasures, making contraception fun, even your disgraces and anathemas, no holes barred! We will help you discriminate between life enhancing GOOD SEX behaviours and those, which hurt real bad.</p>
